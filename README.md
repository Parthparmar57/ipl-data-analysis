# 🏏 IPL Data Analysis Report Generator 

A Python-based data analysis project that processes **IPL (Indian Premier League) ball-by-ball delivery data** to generate a **professional, multi-page PDF report** with rich visual insights. The project uses **Pandas** for data manipulation and **Matplotlib** for high-quality visualizations.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The script analyzes historical IPL delivery-level data and automatically generates a **7-page PDF report** (`report.pdf`) summarizing key batting statistics, trends, and record performances. The output is suitable for presentations, academic projects, or portfolio demonstrations.

## 📊 Key Features

The script `create_ipl_report.py` generates the following report sections:

1. **Executive Summary**

   * Title page with high-level IPL statistics
   * Total matches
   * Total runs scored
   * Number of unique batsmen

2. **Top Run Scorers**

   * Horizontal bar chart of the **Top 10 highest run-scorers** in IPL history

3. **Power Hitters Analysis**

   * Batsmen with the most **sixes (6s)**
   * Batsmen with the most **fours (4s)**

4. **Run Distribution**

   * Pie chart showing frequency of different run values (0s, 1s, 2s, 4s, 6s, etc.)
   * Histogram showing overall run distribution

5. **Death Over Specialists & Strike Rate Analysis**

   * Top boundary hitters in **death overs (16–20)**
   * Strike rate comparison of top batsmen (minimum 500 runs)

6. **Player Spotlight – Virat Kohli**

   * Detailed breakdown of Virat Kohli’s performance against different teams

7. **Record Performances**

   * Styled table of the **Top 5 highest individual scores** in a single IPL match
